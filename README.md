HTTPClient is a Swift library designed to abstract away access to Alamofire. The main purpose of the HTTPClient component is to encapsulate endpoints description inside some network abstraction layer to avoid calling Alamofire directly. Enums are used to define enpoints. This allows to make compile-time checks for correct API endpoint accesses.

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 11.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate HTTPClient into your Xcode project with CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Shakuro.HTTPClient'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use CocoaPods, you can integrate Shakuro.HTTPClient simply by copying it to your project.

## Usage

1. Create a couple of endpoints by adopting `HTTPClientAPIEndPoint` protocol.
2. Create responses parsers by adopting `HTTPClientParser` protocol.
3. Create new instanse of `HTTPClient` class.
4. Start your HTTP request by calling `.sendRequest`. You should use completions to handle parsed results.
